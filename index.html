            <h3>Software Engineer</h3>
            <p>Hello, my name is Atharva Jagtap, and I'm an enthusiastic and dedicated developer. With nearly five years
                of experience in computer science, I have honed my skills and expertise in various domains. Backend
                development has always been my primary focus, and I find immense joy in building robust and efficient
                server-side solutions.</p>

            <p>Throughout my journey, I have successfully completed 10 projects that have helped me gain valuable
                hands-on experience. These projects have allowed me to enhance my skills in Java, SQL, AWS, MS Office,
                and version control systems like Git. I am proficient in Java programming and have utilized it
                extensively to develop scalable and high-performance applications.</p>

            <p>In addition to backend development, I have a keen interest in cloud computing and cloud architecture
                setups. I enjoy exploring and implementing cloud solutions, leveraging the power of platforms like AWS
                to deploy and manage applications in a flexible and scalable manner.</p>

            <p>Feel free to explore my portfolio, where you can find detailed information about my projects and the
                technologies I have worked with. I am always open to discussing collaboration opportunities, so please
                don't hesitate to get in touch. I look forward to the possibility of working together to create
                innovative and impactful solutions.
